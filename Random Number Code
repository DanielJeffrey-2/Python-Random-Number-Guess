#This program asks for a random number from 1 to 6, and tells you if you were correct, or incorrect with your guess.

from random import *
print('Today you are going to guess a number between 1 and 6, Good Luck!')
b = int(input('Enter your guess for the number'))
a = randint(1,6)

if a < b:

  print("That was incorrect: %d" %(a))

if a > b:

  print("That was incorrect: %d" %(a))

if a == b:

  print("You were correct!: %d" %(a))
